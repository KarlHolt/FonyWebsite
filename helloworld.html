	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<h2>What is this website?</h2>
	<p>This is a website with no purpose other than being a collection of what i deem interesting. That being said it will 
		probably turn into a site full of my own rants. <br>
		Explore the page if this seems interesting to you, or just to laugh at a clinical insane person interests.</p>
	
	<h2>The tabs</h2>
	<p>This section will explain each tab in top right corner.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Posts: My opinion on random subjects, think twitter but only one user.</li>
		<li>Projects: This is papers for projects I'm doing or have done.</li>
		<li>Kewl numbers: Just some cool numbers I find in the wild.</li>
		<li>About me: Who am i? Why should you listen to me?(you probably shouldn't)</li>
